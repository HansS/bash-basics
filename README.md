Bash  is an sh-compatible command language interpreter that executes 
commands read from the standard input or from a file.  Bash also 
incorporates useful features from the Korn and C shells (ksh and csh).

 Bash is intended to be a conformant implementation of the Shell and Utilities  portion  of  the  IEEE  POSIX  specification  (IEEE  Standard
  1003.1).  Bash can be configured to be POSIX-conformant by default.
